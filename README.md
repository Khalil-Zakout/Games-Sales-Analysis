# Games-Sales-Analysis
## Overview
This project analyzes video game sales data from 2013 until 2018 to uncover trends and insights. It demonstrates the use of various data analysis and visualization techniques using [ **`Python`**, **`Excel`**, and **`Power BI`** ] . The analysis focuses on different aspects of game sales, including genre popularity over the years and total sales figures.


## Significance
This analysis provides valuable insights for stakeholders in the gaming industry, including developers, marketers, and business analysts. Understanding sales trends acroos different regions and genre performance can help in making informed decisions about game development, marketing strategies, and investment opportunities. The visualizations and dashboards created as part of this project offer an intuitive way to explore and interpret sales data, making it easier to identify key trends and patterns.
